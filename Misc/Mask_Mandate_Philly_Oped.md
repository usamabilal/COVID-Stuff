**Philadelphia’s data-driven approach to reinstating the indoor mask mandate is a smart choice that other cities should follow**

Philadelphia recently crossed the threshold for its indoor mask mandate to kick into effect again as of April 18th. The comments section in traditional or social media following this announcements may make you think that absolutely every Philadelphian opposes this mandate. Yet, according to a [CBS News-YouGov poll](https://www.newsweek.com/most-americans-still-support-mask-mandates-states-relax-rules-poll-1678788) in February, 56% of Americans support mask mandates, while a more recent poll by [Axios/Ipsos](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2022/04/12/fewer-americans-than-ever-want-mask-mandates-poll-finds---despite-uptick-in-cases/?sh=4e8328f66954) situates this number at 44%.

We fully agree with the decision that is crucial to act rapidly in times of increasing transmission to avoid further disease and death, and in particular among the more vulnerable members of our community (older adults, individuals with a [compromised immune system](https://whyy.org/articles/im-immunocompromised-how-does-a-mask-protect-me-if-no-one-else-wears-one/)). Allowing a full participation in society is something that disability rights activists fought for decades, and something we thought society had agreed upon when the Americans with Disabilities Act became the law of the land in 1990.  

COVID-19 is an airborne virus that transmits most easily in closed, crowded, and poorly ventilated spaces. According to a [study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7027e1.htm) by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), universal mask usage in a poorly ventilated room reduces aerosol concentrations by 70%. In another [study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7106e1.htm#contribAff) by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, wearing a mask in indoor public places was associated with decreases of 56% (cloth mask) to 83% (respirators such as KN95) in the odds of a given individual testing positive for COVID-19. 

Mandating masks in periods of high transmission represent one of the most effective and simple measures, with minimal risk and unintended consequences. Two CDC studies, [one](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e3.htm) analyzing data from all US states and the [other](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6947e2.htm) analyzing data for counties in Kansas, found that states or counties with mask mandates had lower increases in COVID-19 case and death rates. In doing so, public health officials are avoiding the use of more severe measures including business or school closures, which will have broader social consequences. In fact, we already [know](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/upshot/coronavirus-cities-social-distancing-better-employment.html) that cities that had the most stringent interventions during the 1918 influenza pandemic emerged with much stronger economies. Where do we want Philadelphia to be?

One of the key [reasons](https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/indoor-mask-mandate-philadelphia-businesses-20220411.html&cid=Philly.com+Twitter) that Dr. Cheryl Bettigole, Health Commissioner of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health, has cited to justify the need to act swiftly is the high vulnerability of the population of Philadelphia. [Black](https://drexel.edu/uhc/resources/briefs/Covid-19%20in%20Context/) and [Latino](https://drexel.edu/uhc/resources/briefs/Latino%20Covid-19%20in%20Context/) individuals, which make more than 55% of Philadelphia’s population, suffered the [worst consequences](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306285) of the pandemic in our city. [We have previously shown](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-3936) that in Philadelphia, individuals living in areas of lower socioeconomic status were less frequently tested for COVID-19 and had a much higher likelihood of testing positive. We [have also found](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanam/article/PIIS2667-193X(22)00037-0/fulltext) that Black and Latino individuals in the Philadelphia metropolitan area had a higher likelihood of being hospitalized after testing positive for COVID-19, compared to white individuals. This means that preventing new cases among these populations is key to reducing the burden of COVID-19. And masks are an effective way of doing so. 

To be sure, many people will question the inconsistency of this mandate with the recently changed [CDC Community Levels](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html) metric, which currently situates Philadelphia as a “Low” risk county. However, a deeper look into the CDC metric should make you worry, as it is heavily based on hospital admissions and occupancy. In other words, the CDC Community Levels should not be interpreted as your risk of getting COVID-19 while in Philadelphia, but rather as your risk of having to depend on an overburdened healthcare system if you develop severe COVID-19. Importantly, given that this metric is heavily based on hospitalization indicators, which lag around two weeks after cases increase, the CDC metric is slow to act. On the other hand, the [metrics used by PDPH](https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/guidance/covid-19-response-levels/), while also considering hospitalizations, also take into consideration the trend in cases, allowing the city to act rapidly when a new surge comes, as is the case now. 

We hope that this potential new surge in cases in Philadelphia will not result in the high number of hospitalizations and deaths we have observed in previous waves. The winter 2021 Omicron wave [caused](https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/data/testing/) a peak of deaths higher than the winter 2020 one, when vaccines were only beginning to be available. At this time, as cases start rising and before it is too late, we should increase vaccine booster rates and we should also rapidly activate other measures when needed. We, [and 60% of Americans](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-pandemic-two-years/), support the use of masks to prevent COVID-19 surges. If the last two years have taught us something, is that Philadelphians are willing to make sacrifices for each other’s health. Let’s make a very minor one to continue on that path. Philadelphia’s data-driven approach to rapidly reinstating low-burden measures should be an example for other US cities.
